# Welcome to Contentive

ðŸ‘‹ Contentive is an opensource headless content management system built with Go language. Contentive is powered by AI, with the following features:

- Support hot update content model
- Support content version management
- Provide a fully open RESTful API
- Based on AI, automatically build AI knowledge base
- Based on AI knowledge base, provide AI question and answer service
- Access control

Contentive is a headless CMS, which means that it does not provide a frontend for users to access content. Instead, it provides a RESTful API for developers to access content. But you can use Contentive Admin to manage content.

We provide two types of API:

- Admin API: Used by Contentive Admin to manage content
- User API: Used by frontend applications to access content
