# API Authentication

The Content API uses token-based authentication to secure all API endpoints. This document outlines how to authenticate your API requests.

## Authentication Flow

API authentication uses a token-based system where each API user has a unique token. This token must be included in all API requests.

### Using Your API Token

Include your API token in all requests using the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_api_token>
```

## Interactive Authentication

Try out the authentication system using the components below:

### Set Your API Token

Use this component to set your API token for testing the endpoints:

<Authentication />

After setting your token, it will be stored in your browser's cookies and automatically included in subsequent requests.

### Test Authentication

You can test your API token using this endpoint:

<Requester
  method="GET"
  url="/api/content"
  description="Test your API token by fetching content. Requires appropriate scope."
  type="api"
/>

## Token Validation

The system performs several checks on each request:

1. **Token Presence**

   - Checks if the Authorization header exists
   - Verifies the token format (Bearer token)

2. **Token Status**

   - Validates if the token belongs to an active API user
   - Checks if the token has not expired

3. **Scope Validation**
   - Verifies if the token has the required scopes for the requested operation

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

Returned when authentication fails:

```json
{
  "error": "Missing Authorization header"
}
```

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid Authorization header format"
}
```

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API token"
}
```

```json
{
  "error": "API token has expired"
}
```

### 403 Forbidden

Returned when the token lacks required scopes:

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient scope"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Token Security**

   - Keep your API token secure
   - Never expose tokens in client-side code
   - Rotate tokens periodically
   - Use environment variables for token storage

2. **Scope Management**

   - Request only the scopes you need
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Regularly audit your scope usage

3. **Error Handling**

   - Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
   - Set up token refresh mechanisms
   - Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

4. **Token Expiration**
   - Check token expiration before making requests
   - Implement proper token refresh flows
   - Handle expired token errors gracefully
