## Role Hierarchy

The system implements a hierarchical role system:

1. Super Admin (Highest)
2. Admin
3. Editor
4. Viewer (Lowest)

Each role inherits permissions from roles below it. For example, an Editor can perform all Viewer actions plus their own permissions.

## Security Notes

1. Passwords are securely hashed before storage
2. Email addresses must be unique in the system
3. User names must be unique in the system
4. All actions are logged for audit purposes
5. Token-based authentication is required for all endpoints
6. Role-based access control is strictly enforced
