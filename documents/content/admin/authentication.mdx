# Authentication

The Admin API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication to secure all administrative endpoints. This document outlines the authentication process and requirements.

## Authentication Flow

1. Obtain a JWT token by logging in through the authentication endpoint:

<Requester
  method="POST"
  url="/admin/auth/login"
  defaultBody={`{
"email": "admin@admin.com",
"password": "admin123"
}`}
  description="Login to obtain your JWT token"
  type="admin"
/>

The successful response will include your token and user information:

```json
{
  "token": "your.jwt.token",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "name": "User Name",
    "email": "user.email@example.com",
    "role": "SuperAdmin"
  }
}
```

2. Include the token in all subsequent requests using the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## Interactive Authentication

Try out the authentication system using the components below:

### Set Your Token

Use this component to set your authentication token for testing the API endpoints:

<Authentication />

After setting your token, this token will be stored in your browser's cookies.

### Test Authentication

You can test your authentication token using this endpoint:

<Requester
  method="GET"
  url="/admin/users"
  description="Test your authentication by fetching the list of users. Requires Viewer role or above."
  type="admin"
/>

If your token is valid, you will receive a list of users. Otherwise, you will receive an error.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements a hierarchical role-based access control system. Each endpoint requires specific role permissions to access.

### Available Roles

Roles are arranged in hierarchical order (from highest to lowest access level):

1. **Super Admin** (`SuperAdmin`)

   - Has full access to all system features
   - Can manage other admin users
   - Required for schema management and API user operations

2. **Editor** (`Editor`)

   - Can manage content and media
   - Access to content creation, editing, and publishing
   - Can manage media files

3. **Viewer** (`Viewer`)
   - Read-only access to content
   - Can view user information
   - Cannot make modifications

### Role Requirements

Different endpoints require different role levels:

- **Super Admin Required:**

  - Schema management (`/admin/schema/*`)
  - API user management (`/admin/api/*`)
  - Admin user management (`/admin/user/*`)

- **Editor Required:**

  - Content management (`/admin/content/*`)
  - Media management (`/admin/media/*`)

- **Viewer Required:**
  - Viewing users (`/admin/users/*`)
  - Viewing individual user details (`/admin/user/:id`)

## Error Responses

Authentication errors will return appropriate HTTP status codes:

- **401 Unauthorized**

  - Missing Authorization header
  - Invalid token

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Missing Authorization header"
  }
  ```

- **403 Forbidden**

  - Insufficient role permissions

  ```json
  {
    "error": "Access denied"
  }
  ```

- **500 Internal Server Error**
  - Server-side authentication errors
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Failed to fetch user"
  }
  ```

## Security Best Practices

1. Keep your JWT token secure and never share it
2. Implement token rotation for long-running applications
3. Use HTTPS for all API requests
4. Log out properly when finished to invalidate the token
5. Monitor for suspicious authentication attempts

## Token Format

The JWT token contains the following claims:

- User ID
- Role information
- Token expiration time

Ensure your token is always valid and not expired when making requests.
